    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This sourdough bread recipe takes time to make as the dough is rested overnight, but it's so worth the wait!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
        <li>1 cup sourdough starter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup corn oil</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>6 cups bread flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix water, sourdough starter, oil, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Sift flour and add to the mixture. Grease or oil dough and place in an oiled bowl; cover and let rise overnight.</li>
        <li>The next day, grease two 8 x 4-inch loaf pans. Knead dough for 10 minutes; divide in half and place into prepared pans. Allow dough to double in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake loaves in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, about 40 to 45 minutes. Carefully tip loaves out of pan onto a work surface and gently tap the bottom of loaf. If it sounds hollow, bread is done.</li>
    </ol>
